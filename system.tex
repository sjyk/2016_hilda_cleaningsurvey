\section{The Future of Data Cleaning}\label{sec:future}
Hereâ€™s a general system/interactive loop that is pie in the sky that would work for the 99\% cases

Concrete Technical Problems 1 2 3 4 with possible solutions.

Usability -- mapping user interactions to the many many algorithms

Automate what you can -- string value data cleaning.  Wha??  What has been automated and what we think can be automated aka hyperparameter tuning. 

What effects did this cleaning have on the whole dataset?

Debugging for data cleaning

Combating overfitting
